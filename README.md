# chicks-gold-test

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### General

- The project structure consists of custom components which are located in the components folder, in turn these are used in a main file called app.vue which in an organized way complies with the required design.

- Finally we have a main css file which is located inside the assets folder, it is called main.css.

- Resources such as images are inside Public.

- A file called data.ts is used which is located in the boot folder, this is used to emulate the data (Games) that are displayed in the card list.
